## Experience
* **Eatron Technologies, Machine Learning Intern, Nov. 2023 to Present**
  * Eatron is a fast-growing technology company dedicated to unlocking the full potential of batteries with intelligent software for all vehicle and battery manufacturers worldwide. 
  *  Conducted PyBAMM battery simulations to validate the compatibility between user cases and simulation parameters.
  * Used the SEI thickness data obtained from the simulation to decrease error in the current ML pipeline, estimating the remaining useful life.
* **BASE AS, Mechanical Design Intern, Aug. 2023 to Sep. 2023**
  *  BASE is a full-system supplier of heavy-duty drivetrain packages including axle, suspension, transfer case, and thru drive unit, as well as complete running chassis.
  * Designed 30 sub-components of 8x8 axles such as serrated flanges and bearing plates.
  * Inspected our and competitors’axledesigns and analyzed corresponding stress differences resulting from the design choices between two axles.
  * Conducted torque, temperature, and vibration tests on these axles.
* **Navio Technology, System Engineer, Feb. 2023 to Apr. 2023**
  *  NAVIO is an aerospace and defense technology company that develops and manufactures safety critical avionics, aerospace grade sensors and high-precision aerospace parts
  * Used Reinforcement Learning and Attention models to complete writing of system requirement tasks.
* **COLORS Lab, Research Intern, Oct. 2022 to present**
  * Developed the AttCNMP architecture,which learned robotic demonstrations faster with smaller reconstruction losses than the vanilla CNMP.
  * Worked on developing LW-CNMP, a new method for blending various demonstrations using weights obtained from a Gaussian distribution for each time step, and prepared the necessary experiments for validation.
  * Written an analytical inverse kinematics solution for UR10, a 6-DOF robotic arm.
