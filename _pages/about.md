Hi, I am Ediz!
------

<p align="justify">
I’m currently a senior mechanical engineering student at Boğaziçi University.

I love combining mathematics and software with my engineering knowledge. That's why I want to work on interdisciplinary research and projects that include these domains, such as computational science and engineering, control, and optimization. In my free time, I like to learn programming and computer tools that will help me increase my creativity, such as Html, CSS, and video and photo editors. Also, dealing with old computers or electronic gadgets to repair or build new versions gives me great fun. Currently, I am working in my university's Haptics & Robotics Laboratory on the modeling and simulation of a soft robot. Besides, I am participating in a data science bootcamp where I am learning about data analysis with Python.

In my spare time, I like to do almost all kinds of sports, such as tennis, basketball, and football, which I do from time to time with friends. At my university, I participated in hobby clubs such as dance, mountaineering, and skiing. My true passion is nature sports, where I feel the freedom and the beauty of the world entirely. I have been doing kitesurf since 2015 and became an instructor over the years. In the Summer of 2020, I worked as a kitesurf instructor in Izmir, Turkey, where I enjoyed teaching kitesurf to many people coming from all over the world. Also, I founded a surfing community at my university at the beginning of Fall 2022 to introduce this sport to more people and enjoy surfing activities together.
