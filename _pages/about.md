Hi, I am Ediz!

<p align="justify">

I love combining mathematics and software with my engineering and physics knowledge. That's why I am trying to work on research and projects that includes these domains and in my free times I do programming as a fun activity. Currently, I am working in the Haptics & Robotics Laboratory of my university about control of a soft robot. Besides, I am participating in a data science bootcamp where I learn about data analysis with Python.

In my spare time, I like to do sports either myself or with a group through hobby clubs at my university, such as dance, mountaineering, and skiing clubs. Also, I am organizing events for the surfing community I founded at the beginning of 2022. I have been doing kitesurf since 2015, and now I want to introduce this sport to more people and enjoy surfing activities together. In the Summer of 2020, I worked as a kitesurf instructor in Izmir, Turkey, where I taught kitesurf to people from all over the world.
