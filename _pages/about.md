Hi, I am Ediz! Welcome to my personal website. :smile:

<p align="justify">
I’m a senior mechanical engineering undergraduate student at Boğaziçi University which is a highly prestigious school with most of its students placed in 0.1% in the nationwide exam. With a 3.59 GPA, I am currently ranked 10th in the mechanical engineering department among 62 students.

I love combining mathematics and software with my engineering knowledge. That's why I am trying to work on research and projects that includes these domains and in my free times I do programming as a fun activity. Currently, I am working in the Haptics & Robotics laboratory of my university about control of a soft robot. Besides, I am participating in a data science bootcamp where I learn about data analysis with Python.

None academic stuff...

Kitesurf is by far my favourite sport. I learned it from my uncle and doing it since 2015. I became an instructor and taught kitesurf to people in Turkey and Portugal for two summers. In 2022, I founded a surf community in my university to introduce this sport to more people and organize surfing activities including wavesurf, windsurf, kitesurf, and wakeboard.

I was always into sports. In primary school, I was a licensed basketball player. I believe part of my discipline and dedication are gained there. I started to play tennis in high school and I still do it in my free times. I also like skiing and hiking where you can discover new mountains and feel the nature.
