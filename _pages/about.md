Hi, I am Ali!
------

<p align="justify">
I am currently pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering at Bogazici University, with an anticipated graduation date of January 2024.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I am presently engaged in research focusing on Conditional Neural Movement Primitives. My work primarily revolves around decision making in uncertainty and learning multimodal demonstrations, with a specific emphasis on  blending of these demonstrations.

In the <A HREF="/projects/">Projects</A> section, you can find summaries of the projects I was involved in.

During my leisure moments, I enjoy participating in a wide range of sports, including football, calisthenics, and bouldering. While at university, I enthusiastically participated in a multitude of hobby clubs, such as music, fine arts, and chess. My true passion lies in creating things and experiencing new stuff, particularly when it offers me the chance to engage with the world's innate beauty.
</p>
<p align="justify">
From the earliest stages of self-discovery, I have been drawn to making melodies and writing songs. I currently have a band "Eser Miktarda" where I contribute as the guitarist and lead vocalist. I was also a tenor in Bogazici University Jazz Choir for 3 years. Furthermore, I enjoy creating realistic drawings using charcoal.

I have not released my album yet. But you can listen to one of my songs by clicking the left image below :)
