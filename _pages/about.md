Hi, I am Ediz!
------

<p align="justify">
I’m currently a senior mechanical engineering student at Boğaziçi University.

In the <A HREF="/projects/">Projects</A> section, you can find summaries of the projects I was involved in.

I love combining mathematics and software with my engineering knowledge. That's why I want to work on interdisciplinary research and projects that include these domains, such as computational modeling with machine learning, control and optimization. I also like to learn programming and computer tools that help me update this website and create content, such as Html, CSS, and I try to improve my coding skills in Python for data science and machine learning. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
In my spare time, I like to do almost all kinds of sports, such as tennis, basketball, and football. At my university, I participated in hobby clubs such as dance, mountaineering, and skiing. My true passion is nature sports, where I feel the freedom and the beauty of the world entirely. I have been doing kitesurf since 2015 and became an instructor over the years. In the Summer of 2020, I worked as a kitesurf instructor in Izmir, Turkey, where I enjoyed teaching kitesurf to many people coming from all over the world. Also, I founded a surfing community at my university at the beginning of Fall 2022 to introduce this sport to more people and enjoy surfing activities together.
