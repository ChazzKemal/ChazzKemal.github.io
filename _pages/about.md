I have a strong passion for creating innovative and time-saving solutions. As a devoted mechanical engineer, I thrive on my curiosity about a multitude of subjects. This has naturally led me to specialize in robotics and additive manufacturing, areas in which I have pursued numerous graduate and online courses. At present, I am dedicated to leveraging my honed skills in practical projects within these realms.

My proficiency spans Python and C++, tools I wield comfortably in robotics initiatives. This encompasses everything from microcontrollers to intricate deep learning models, as well as computational modeling, control systems, and optimization techniques.My enthusiasm not only rests in applying knowledge but also in delving into the profound principles that underlie the enchanting fabric of our universe.

During my leisure moments, I enjoy participating in a wide range of sports, including football, calisthenics, and bouldering. While at university, I enthusiastically participated in a multitude of hobby clubs, such as music, fine arts, and chess. My true passion lies in creating things and experiencing new stuff, particularly when it offers me the chance to engage with the world's innate beauty.

From the earliest stages of self-discovery, I have been drawn to making melodies and writing songs. I currently have a band "Eser Miktarda" where I play guitar and sing. I was also a tenor in Bogazici University Jazz Choir for 3 years. Furthermore, I love drawing realistic charcoal drawings. It's the detailed nuances of this medium that particularly resonate with my aesthetic sensibilities, offering me a unique form of gratification.
